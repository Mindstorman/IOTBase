This is the abstracted code from a hobby project.
The python code runs on a Raspberry Pi wired with a IR reciever
The C code is run on a NodeMCU ESP8266
This project requires a MQTT broker to handle the backend as well as 
NodeRed to handle the processing and allow easy changes to the remotes buttons
